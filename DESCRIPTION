Description: The R package spCorr provides a flexible and scalable framework 
    for detecting and characterizing spatially varying correlations (SVCs) 
    in spatial transcriptomics data. It enables spot-level estimation of 
    geneâ€“gene correlations, identifies gene pairs whose correlations vary 
    across space or between tissue domains, and supports flexible modeling 
    of count data and spot-level covariates with efficient, permutation-free 
    statistical inference.
